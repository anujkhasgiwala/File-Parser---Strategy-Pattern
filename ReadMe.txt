The home work assignment 1 of Object Oriented Software Development has various files kept in different package and different folder as mentioned below:
1. UML and Sequence diagrams are kept in folder named as "diagrams"
2. Input files are present in a folder named as "inputFiles". User needs to provide the relative or absolute path of file
3. As per the logic implemented by me, the output files will be created in a folder named as "outputFiles" so user need to give only output file name without extension
4. The java code is kept under "src" folder

The main method is in PersonObjectReaderWriter.java class in com.usu.fileReaderWriter package

I have used maven for dependency resolution and created the project as maven project. All the required dependencies are present in pom.xml file.

There was no input file that fulfills all comparison condition together so I have tested them for different files. Out of these files I have pasted few in the input folder.
JSON:
PersonTestSet_02 fulfills 1st comparison
PersonTestSet_03 fulfills 3rd comparison

XML:
PersonTestSet_11 fulfills 3rd condition
